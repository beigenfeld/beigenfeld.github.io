		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p align="center">I am a Milwaukee native, born and raised, and have always lived in the greater Milwaukee area.  My parents are Heidi and Jerry, and have been married for 42 years.  I have one older brother, David, and one younger sister, Amber.  I graduated from Menomonee Falls High School, and attended college at Waukesha County Technical College, earning an Associates Degree in Mechanical Design.  For the past 13 years, I have worked at a construction association, Associated General Contractors of Greater Milwaukee.</p>
